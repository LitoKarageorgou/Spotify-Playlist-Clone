# 🎧 Spotify Playlist Clone

A single-page Spotify playlist layout, built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**, as part of a front-end development bootcamp assignment.

## 📋 Project Description

The goal of this project was to recreate a static version of a Spotify-like UI based on a given design reference (see below). The layout includes a sidebar, top navigation, playlist section, and a sticky banner, all styled to closely match the original design using HTML and CSS.

No JavaScript was used — the focus was on visual accuracy and layout structure.
